        You: Hey... nice weather we're having? Nice and.. bubbly?
        Breathing Fish: You're terrible at small talk. 
        Breathing Fish: ...You're going, aren't you? You don't have the time.
        You: Yeah... if I don't...
        You: What Lies Above will come for everything below.

        You: Not to burst your bubble, but... I'm leaving.
        Breathing Fish: Har har... I still have enough air for awhile yet.
        Breathing Fish: But you're really doing it now?
        You: Yup. If i don't go now, What Lies Above will come for everything below.

        You: Of course you'd be here to see me off.
        Breathing Fish: You're finally going?
        You: Yup. If i don't go now, What Lies Above will come for everything below.

        You: I'm finally going out to contain What Lies Above.
        Breathing Fish: No more time left, huh? Now or never.
        You: Now or never. I wait any longer and it'll come for everything below.
